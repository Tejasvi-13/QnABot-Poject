#  QnA Bot using Azure Language Studio & AI Search
This is a chatbot project built using Microsoft Azure's Language Studio and AI Search. 
It allows users to ask questions and get answers from a document-based knowledge base, using natural language.

# Project Objective
To build a QnA Bot that can:
- Read and index documents using Azure AI Search
- Answer questions through a bot interface
- Be tested locally using Bot Framework Emulator
- Secure the infrastructure using Private Endpoints (planned)
- Be exposed to public access using Azure Application Gateway (planned)

# Introduction
During my internship in the Cloud Infrastructure and Security domain, I worked on building a QnA Bot using Azure Language Services. The main goal was to help users query documents and get relevant answers automatically. Instead of using AI-generated answers, this bot works with a document-based knowledge base uploaded by the user, providing accurate and reliable responses. The solution was developed using Node.js, hosted on Azure App Service, and tested using Bot Framework Emulator. Due to subscription constraints, the bot could not be deployed on Microsoft Teams, and this is honestly reflected in the report.

# Technologies Used
- Azure Language Studio  
- Azure AI Search  
- Azure App Service (Web App)  
- Node.js  
- Bot Framework Emulator  
- Kudu for deployment
